# Gatsby Portfolio

My portfolio, built with Gatsby using markdown posts.

## TODO
- Add more info to SEO component
- Add Page transitions
- more uniformity in focus states, apply focus-visible states to fx projects
- streamline breakpoints, especially project pages
- figure out images, maybe use full size and quality then let gatsby handle sizing/quality
- Project - sticky
- change size for moving aside/socials to fixed position
- Move layout change to 961 instead of 900px
