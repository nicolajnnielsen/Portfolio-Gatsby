# Gatsby Portfolio

My portfolio site, showcasing some of my web development projects, built with Gatsby using markdown posts.

## TODO

- change transition when moving from project pages - need to change nav depending on location
- prev/next links on project pages
- Reset focus after navigation - figure out best approach, what to focus on
