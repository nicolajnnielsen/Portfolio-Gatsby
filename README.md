# Gatsby Portfolio

My portfolio, built with Gatsby using markdown posts.

## TODO
- Add more info to SEO component
- Optimize images, maybe use full size and quality then let gatsby handle sizing/quality
- change transition when moving from project pages - need to change nav depending on location
- prev/next links on project pages
- test contact form, set up redirect after submit?
- Reset focus after navigation - figure out best approach, what to focus on
- Redo skill bubbles with properly interactive elements
